            Please perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions. Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.

            ## Output Instructions

            1. Review all changed files in the PR thoroughly.
            2. Post exactly ONE top-level comment using `gh pr comment` containing ALL findings.
            3. Do NOT use `gh pr review` with inline comments.
            4. Do NOT post multiple comments. Everything must be in a SINGLE `gh pr comment`.

            ## Comment Format

            The comment must follow this exact structure:
            ```markdown
            ## Code Review Summary

            <2-3 sentence overall assessment>

            ## Actionable Fixes

            Copy everything below the line and pass it to Claude Code:

            ---

            In this repository, please make the following changes:

            1. **[SECURITY]** File `path/to/file.ts`, line 42: <specific instruction>
            2. **[BUG]** File `path/to/file.ts`, line 87: <specific instruction>
            3. **[PERFORMANCE]** File `path/to/other.py`, line 15: <specific instruction>
            4. **[QUALITY]** File `path/to/file.ts`, line 33: <specific instruction>
            5. **[TESTING]** File `path/to/test.ts`: <specific instruction>
            6. **[DOCS]** File `README.md`: <specific instruction>

            After making all changes, run the existing tests to make sure nothing is broken.
            ```

            ## Rules
            - Everything in ONE `gh pr comment` call, no inline comments
            - Use exact file paths relative to repo root with line numbers from the diff
            - Each fix must be a specific actionable instruction, not vague advice
            - Use category tags: [SECURITY], [BUG], [PERFORMANCE], [QUALITY], [TESTING], [DOCS]
            - Order by priority: security > bugs > performance > quality > testing > docs
            - Skip praise or observations that require no code changes
            - If no fixes needed, say "No actionable fixes required"
